Conversely, we derive conditions under which a given lattice point becomes the next visible point along such a polynomial curve. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we also obtain an exact double-sum formula for the number of pairs (a, b) less than or equal to N that are visible with respect to this polynomial family.\n  Finally, we extend the framework to related problems and pose several open questions concerning gap distributions and quantitative bounds for non-visible points.

Indeed, we confirm the well-known conjecture that Chebyshev polynomials are the only complex polynomials whose geometric iterated Galois groups have positive fixed-point proportion. Our proof relies on methods from group theory, ergodic theory, martingale theory and complex dynamics.
