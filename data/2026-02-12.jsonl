For such a variety \\(M \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{n\\times t}\\), we prove that its Hermitian distance degree equals the real Euclidean distance degree of the associated absolutely symmetric variety of singular values. Equivalently, for a generic data matrix, Hermitian distance critical points on \\(M\\) are obtained by lifting Euclidean distance critical points from the singular-value slice. We also establish a Hermitian slicing theorem, paralleling the Bik--Draisma principle, which reduces the critical point count to a diagonal slice. As a motivating example, we recover a geometric Hermitian analogue of the Eckart-Young theorem."}

This result is one of the most powerful computational tools in the study of modular forms, and has widespread applications to congruences and other kinds of explicit calculations in mathematics and physics. In this paper, we formulate a new ``$p$-adic transfer method\" that lifts Sturm-type bounds from one space to another using exclusively non-geometric inputs. As an application, we transfer the Sturm bounds for classical modular forms to the space of quasimodular forms of level one. These bounds are applicable uniformly for quasimodular forms with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$, which extends the non-uniform results for $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ only which can be derived from classical theories. We also discuss the potential for future applications to other quasi- and mixed-weight modular objects, and perhaps even entirely non-modular objects."}

The main contributions are the derivation of explicit symmetry formulas for cyclotomic multiple (Hurwitz) zeta values, which are obtained directly through analytic residue calculations, without reliance on algebraic regularization. As a concrete application, we deduce analogous symmetry theorems for cyclotomic multiple zeta values and cyclotomic multiple $t$-values. The results extend and complement recent symmetry investigations by Charlton and Hoffman, offering completely explicit and regularization-free formulas in the convergent setting. Moreover, the results of this paper can be used to prove the symmetry conjecture for cyclotomic multiple Hurwitz zeta values with multiple variables and a single parameter. Furthermore, several illustrative corollaries and examples are included, and an open problem concerning possible extensions to other variants of multiple zeta values is posed at the conclusion."}

This raises a natural family-level question: does the same phenomenon persist inside one-parameter families, where the local structure varies in a highly constrained way?\n  In this paper we answer this in the negative for the pure fields $K_m=\\mathbb Q(α)$ with $α^n=m$ ($n\\ge 4$) and $m$ square-free. Writing $g(m)=[\\mathcal O_{K_m}:\\mathbb Z[α]]$, we prove that the set of square-free $m$ for which $g(m)>1$ but $K_m$ has no ABS local obstruction has natural density $0$. Consequently, in the pure family monogenicity and $α$--monogenicity have the same natural density. The proof isolates a reusable mechanism, which we call the Eisenstein-prime obstruction sieve. The argument is packaged in an abstract template and transfers to other Eisenstein parameter families."}
