In this paper, we further study this regularity for abelian surfaces, providing explicit formulas involving quasi-modular forms. This resonates with the small genus cases of the toric setting."}

By constructing the $n$-th Poisson-Jensen formula, the $n$-th tropical counting, proximity, and characteristic functions are introduced, which have some different properties compared to the classical tropical setting. Then, not only is the $n$-th version of the second main theorem for tropical homogeneous polynomials obtained, but also a tropical second main theorem for ordinary Fermat type polynomials is acquired. Moreover, by estimating the tropical logarithmic derivative with a growth assumption pointwise, a strong equality is proved. This equality illustrates the relationship between $\\sum_{i=0}^{m}N(r, 1_{0}\\oslash f_{i})$ and the ramification term $N(r, C_{0}(f_{0}, \\cdots, f_{m}))$, implying that there is no natural tropical truncated version of the second main theorem for shift operators."}
