Combining this with the algorithmic results provided by S.D. Cohen et al., we confirm the conjecture in \\cite{Cohen} concerning all finite fields satisfying this condition. Furthermore, we obtain several elementary results for General problem, proving that the number of finite fields satisfying general condition is also finite."}

Furthermore, we explore a variety of properties of these generalized Dedekind sums: we develop a finite sum formula, demonstrate their behavior as quantum modular forms, provide a Fricke reciprocity law, and characterize analytic and arithmetic aspects of their image. Particularly, for the arithmetic aspect of the image, we generalize an existing conjecture to the higher weight case and provide significant computational evidence to support this generalized conjecture."}

We establish basic properties of good maps and introduce a weaker variant, \\textit{weak good maps}.
