In the cases where $ν$ is either very small or very large compared with $n$, this recovers many previously known results. We demonstrate that our inequalities are sharp by providing an explicit characterisation of those varieties achieving the equality; our proof, in particular, resolves the Abundance conjecture in this situation. Additionally, we provide some new examples of varieties with extremal Chern classes that demonstrate the optimality of our results."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this paper we study the Wahl map for the normalization of a $δ$-nodal curve $C$ on a Hirzebruch surface $\\mathbb{F}_{n}$ for $n\\geq 0$. Let $σ:X\\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{n}$ be the blow up of $\\mathbb{F}_{n}$ along the $δ$ nodes of $C$ and let $\\widetilde{C}$ be the normalization of $C$ under $σ$. Let $K_{X}$ be the canonical bundle of $X$ and let $Ω^{1}_{X}$ be the sheaf of $1$-holomorphic forms on $X$. We give conditions for the surjectivity of the map $Φ_{X,\\mathcal{O}_{X}(K_{X}+\\widetilde{C})}: \\bigwedge^{2}H^{0}(X,\\mathcal{O}_{X}(K_{X}+\\widetilde{C}))\\rightarrow H^{0}(X,Ω^{1}_{X}(2K_{X}+2\\widetilde{C}))$.

The key innovation is a new approach to the computation of the $p$-divisibility index of certain special elements in Galois cohomology (the bottom class of a $Λ$-adic Euler system twisted by a character sufficiently close to the trivial character) based on a reformulation of the Iwasawa Main Conjectures in terms of determinants of Selmer complexes."}

This is a generalization of the remarkable Dineva formula, which corresponds to $s=0$ and gives $n/\\varphi(n)$ on the right-hand side. We explain why only squarefree divisors are involved, show how multiplicativity naturally comes into play, and interpret the identity as a finite Euler product. Beyond this one-parameter family of generalizations, we describe a general method for constructing similar formulas and present several examples. Finally, we reformulate these identities in terms of partial zeta functions, thus emphasizing their close relationship with the classical theory of Euler products and the Riemann zeta function. The connection with the Selberg sieve is briefly outlined."}
