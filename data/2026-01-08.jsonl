Sending a point to the Lie algebra of its stabilizer defines rational maps to various Grassmann varieties. For surfaces of general type, this yields fibrations in curves of genus g at least 2 over the projective line. Using properties of the corresponding moduli stack M_g, we prove that there are no smooth surfaces of general type with an sl_2-triple. On the other hand, employing Lefschetz pencils and Frobenius pullbacks we show that canonical surfaces of general type with such triples exist in abundance. In this connection, we classify the rational double points where the tangent sheaf is free or the evaluation pairing with Kähler differentials is surjetive, including characteristic two."}

Starting from the theory of dualizing sheaves on nodal curves, we reinterpret canonical and higher--order differentials as meromorphic objects on the normalization whose local principal parts are constrained by explicit residue conditions. A key result is the scheme--theoretic residue span theorem, which asserts that %\nfor nodal curves of geometric genus $g$ with $δ$ nodes, when $δ\\ge g$ the residue functionals at the nodes span $H^0(C,ω_C)^\\vee$, so canonical differentials are completely determined by their residue data. This provides a concrete, linear description of $H^0(C,ω_C)$ and yields powerful applications to deformation theory, Severi varieties, and moduli problems.\n  \\vspace{0.1cm}\n  We then develop the residue--balancing principle, showing that global residue conditions on each irreducible component of a singular curve are equivalent to local balancing conditions at the singular points. This equivalence clarifies the local--to--global structure of dualizing sheaves and extends naturally to $k$--differentials. Finally, we address the case of arbitrary singularities, where nodes no longer suffice to describe local geometry. Using normalization and the conductor ideal, we formulate a refined balancing principle that replaces simple residue cancellation by higher--order and conductor--level constraints. Together, these results provide a unified framework for understanding how local singular behavior governs global differentials and their deformations."}

Unlike the construction of [30], in order to construct the $r$-spin cylinder theory we had to overcome the foundational problem of dimension jump loci, which in analogous closed theories has been treated using virtual fundamental class techniques, that are currently absent in the open setting. For this reason our construction is much more involved, and relies on the point insertion technique developed in [31,32].\n  We prove that the open $g=1$ potential equals, after a coordinate change, to the $g=1$ part of the Gelfand-Dikii wave function, thus confirming a conjecture of [7]. We also prove that our $g=1$ intersection numbers satisfy a $g=1$ recursion, also predicted in [7,15]. This recursion is the $g=1$ analogue of Solomon's famous $g=0$ Open WDVV equation [25], with descendents, and is also the universal $g=1$ recursion for $F$-Cohomological field theories [1]. Again, this is first geometric construction which is not the $g=1$ sector of [23,30], proven to satisfy this universal recursion."}
