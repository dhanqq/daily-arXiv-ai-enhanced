When the input curve is real, we prove that every complex liftable member of a given tropical tritangent class either completely lifts to the reals or none of its liftings are defined over the reals.

First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \\mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices."}
