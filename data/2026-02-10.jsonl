CLs are also well-suited to efficient hardware implementation. Here we present the algorithm for arithmetic on CLs, then extend it to the novel contribution of this paper, an algorithm for computing trigonometric, exponential, and log functions on CLs. These methods can be extended to other transcendental functions.\n  As with the corresponding CF algorithms, computations are entirely in the domain of the CL representation, with no floating-point arithmetic; we read one CL input term at a time, producing the next CL term of the result as soon as it is determined. The CL algorithms are in fact simpler than their CF counterparts.\n  We have implemented these algorithms in Haskell."}
