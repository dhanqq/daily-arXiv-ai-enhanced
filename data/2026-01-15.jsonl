We completely answer this question over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or larger than the size of the matrix: An $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ admits a nonzero diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A$ and $A+D$ have the same spectrum if and only if, for some size $k$, the $k \\times k$ principal minors of $A$ are not all equal. This relates to the classical additive inverse eigenvalue problem in numerical analysis and has implications for existence and rigidity results in the theory of Floquet isospectrality of discrete periodic operators in solid state physics. The proof employs new techniques involving Hilbert schemes of points and the infinitesimal structure of the Hilbert--Chow morphism."}

Such fields are partitioned into $20$ distinct Types determined by local conditions at $2$ and $3$, and an explicit integral basis is given in each case. For each Type, the shape of $K$ admits an explicit description in terms of shape parameters. Fixing the sign of $m$ and a Type, we prove that the corresponding shapes are equidistributed along a translated torus orbit in the space of shapes. The limiting distribution is given by an explicit measure expressed as the product of a continuous measure and a discrete measure."}
