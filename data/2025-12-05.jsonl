For classification problem with large or unknown number of classes this allows to construct classifiers without classification layer and extend the number of classes without retraining of network from the very beginning. The construction allows to create large well-spaced vector collections in spaces of minimal possible dimension. If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors. Also, regular symmetric structure of constructed vector collections can significantly simplify problems of search for nearest cluster centers or embeddings in the latent space. Construction of vector collections is based on combinatorics and geometry of semi-simple Lie groups irreducible representations with highest weight."}

Let us recall that it is well-known that the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the absolute Galois group of the given mixed-characteristic local field is injective. Moreover, Hoshi and the author of the present paper proved that, for absolutely abelian mixed-characteristic local fields with odd residue characteristic $p$ and even extension degree over ${\\mathbb Q}_p$, this subgroup arising from field automorphisms is not normal in the outer automorphism group and has infinitely many distinct conjugates. As a result in this direction, one of the main results of the present paper is the assertion that if a 2-adic local field satisfies certain conditions, then the set of conjugates of the subgroup arising from field automorhisms in the outer automorphism group is infinite, which thus implies that this subgroup is not normal in the outer automorphism group. On the other hand, for an odd prime number $p$, Hoshi proved the existence of an irreducible Hodge-Tate $p$-adic representation of dimension two of the absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic local field and an automorphism of the absolute Galois group such that the $p$-adic Galois representation obtained by pulling back the given $p$-adic Galois representation by the given automorphism is not Hodge-Tate.
