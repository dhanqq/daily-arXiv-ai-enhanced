Our primary result is a structural factorization of the transition matrix $C$ between the Mirković--Vilonen (MV) basis and the convolution basis into $C = P \\cdot M \\cdot A \\cdot Q^{-1}$, where the four factors represent: equivariant localization ($Q$), fusion via nearby cycles ($A$), local intersection cohomology stalks ($M$), and diagonal normalization ($P$). Utilizing this factorization, and by introducing the Geometric Efficiency metric ($η$) we establish a Universal Geometric Rank Bound, proving that the rank of the transition matrix $C$ is bounded by the dimension of the local Braden--MacPherson (BMP) stalks."}

We construct an intrinsic three-term deformation complex on $X$ whose fibers encode transverse first-order classes and primary obstructions, and whose cohomology agrees on the operadic loci with the standard low-degree deformation cohomology (à la Gerstenhaber and Nijenhuis--Richardson). We then define a canonical quadratic map $κ^{inc}_{2,μ}\\colon H^2_{inc}(μ)\\to H^3_{inc}(μ)$ that controls second-order lifts modulo isotriviality. If $μ$ is smooth point in a reduced component and $(κ^{inc}_{2,μ})^{-1}(0)=\\{0\\}$, then the $G$-orbit of $μ$ is Zariski open in that component.
