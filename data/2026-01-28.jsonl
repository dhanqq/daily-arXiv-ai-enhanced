We extend the theory to cactus varieties of toric varieties over any algebraically closed field. A border cactus decomposition is a mulithomogeneous ideal in the Cox ring (also called the total coordinate ring) of the toric variety that witnesses that a given point is in a specific cactus variety. The definition of such witness uses apolarity and we describe the set of ideals that are credible witnesses for this purpose in terms of a correspondence between the usual Hilbert scheme (parametrising all closed subschemes of the toric variety) and the multigraded Hilbert scheme (parametrising all multihomogeneous ideals in the Cox ring). We also take this opportunity to extend the border apolarity to linear subspaces (in non-border setting, this is equivalent to simultaneous decompositions)."}

We consider a classical method to obtain lower bounds that goes back at least to C.J. Smyth, and a method to obtain upper bounds based on the knowledge of the limit distribution of integral points. We use an infinite dimensional linear programming scheme to show that that both methods agree in the limit, by showing that the principle of strong duality holds in our situation. As a corollary we prove that the essential minimum can be attained by sequences of algebraic integers.\n  Recent results by A. Smith and B. Orloski--N. Sardari, furnish a characterization of compactly supported measures that can be approximated by complete sets of conjugates of algebraic integers, in terms of infinitely many nonnegativity conditions. We establish an extension of this characterization to measures with non necessarily compact support. As an application of this result and of strong duality, we show that the essential minimum is a computable real number when the Green function used to define the height is computable. We systematically use potential theory for measures that can integrate functions with logarithmic growth."}
