In particular, we prove the following result in a slightly modified form: If $α$ is an irrational number having a continued fraction expansion with bounded terms (in particular, if $α$ is a quadratic irrational), then the number of primes $p$ in the interval $(X-Y,X]$ satisfying $||pα||<δ$ is asymptotically equal to $2δY/\\log X$, provided that $X\\ge 10$, $X^{2/3+\\varepsilon}\\le Y\\le X/2$ and $X^{\\varepsilon}\\max\\left\\{X^{1/4}Y^{-1/2},X^{2/3}Y^{-1}\\right\\}\\le δ\\le 1/2$."}

We prove that such points correspond to number fields of the class number one. As an application, one gets a solution to the Gauss conjecture for the real quadratic fields of class number one."}

In this paper, we prove some parity results\n  for the reciprocals of some false theta functions by using some identities on Ramanujan's general theta function. In particular, our results imply some conjectures of Keith."}

The Kloosterman sum for an $SL_4$-long word is decomposed into finer parts (called the fine Kloosterman sum), and can be written as a finite sum of a product of two classical Kloosterman sums."}

We show that when $X$ is ruled, the group of birational transformations $Bir(X)$, as a group, determines $X$ up to birational transformations and automorphisms of the base field. In contrast, we demonstrate that this same property never holds for non-uniruled varieties."}
