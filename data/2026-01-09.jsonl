There is a canonical $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear projection operator $\\mathsf{taut}: \\mathsf{CH}^*(\\mathcal{A}_g) \\rightarrow \\mathsf{R}^*(\\mathcal{A}_g).$ We present here new calculations of intersection products of the Torelli locus in $\\mathcal{A}_g$ with the product loci $\\mathcal{A}_{r}\\times \\mathcal{A}_{g-r} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}_g$ for $r\\leq 3$. The results suggest that $\\mathsf{taut}$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-algebra homomorphism, at least for special cycles. We discuss a conjectural framework for this homomorphism property.\n  Our calculations follow two independent approaches. The first is a direct study of the excess intersection geometry of the fiber product of the Torelli and product morphisms. The second recasts the geometry in terms of families Gromov-Witten classes, which are computed by a wall-crossing formula related to unramified maps.\n  We define tautological projections of cycles on the fiber products $\\mathcal X_g^s \\to \\mathcal A_g$ of the universal family. We compute these projections for a class of product cycles on $\\mathcal X_g^s$ in terms of a determinant involving the universal theta divisors and Poincaré classes. Using Abel-Jacobi pullbacks of product cycles on $\\mathcal X_g^s$ and their projections, we construct a new family of classes which we conjecture to lie in the Gorenstein kernels of the tautological rings $\\mathsf{R}^*(\\mathcal M^{\\mathrm{ct}}_{g,n})$.

The real complement of such a hypersurface partitions its ambient space into open regions. In this paper, we propose a new method for computing these regions. Existing methods for computing regions require the explicit equation of the hypersurface as input. However, computing this equation by elimination can be computationally demanding or even infeasible. Our approach instead derives from univariate interpolation by computing the intersection of the hypersurface with a line. Such an intersection can be done using so-called pseudo-witness sets without computing a defining equation for the hypersurface - we perform elimination without actually eliminating. We implement our approach in a forthcoming Julia package and demonstrate, on several examples, that the resulting algorithm accurately recovers all regions of the real complement of a hypersurface."}

The analysis applies to curves beyond the nodal case and is not restricted to plane curves, encompassing curves lying on smooth projective surfaces as well as families with more general isolated singularities. Using deformation-theoretic and residue-theoretic methods, we describe how the infinitesimal period map decomposes into local contributions supported at singular points, together with global constraints arising from the geometry of the normalization. While nodal singularities give rise to nontrivial rank-one contributions, other singularities may contribute only through higher-order local data or may be invisible at the infinitesimal level. As a consequence, we obtain sharp criteria for maximal infinitesimal variation in terms of numerical invariants of the curve, notably when the number of nodes satisfies the inequality $δ\\ge g$, where $g$ denotes the genus of the normalization.\n  We extend these results to curves on very general surfaces in projective three-space, showing that maximal variation persists on Picard-rank-one surfaces but fails for sufficiently large genus in the presence of higher ADE singularities. These results extend classical maximality phenomena in infinitesimal Hodge theory to a broader singular and geometric setting."}

We prove semicontinuity and openness results showing that maximal variation is stable in flat families, identify a natural determinantal degeneracy locus where maximal variation fails, and establish that this failure is governed entirely by the presence of non-Gorenstein singularities. In particular, all smooth and nodal curves satisfy maximal variation, while every non-Gorenstein singularity contributes explicitly and additively to degeneracy. We compute the expected codimension of degeneracy loci, describe their closure and adjacency relations in moduli, and explain how non-Gorenstein defects give rise to additional Hodge-theoretic phenomena in degenerations. This framework provides a uniform, intrinsic, and deformation-theoretically meaningful classification of degeneracy in spaces of canonical differentials."}

A Hecke vector-form can be viewed as a vector function represen- tation of some quasiautomorphic form that transforms like an automorphic form on an arbitrarily chosen Hecke triangle group. In other words, because quasiautomorphic forms have complicated transformation behavior when compared with automorphic forms, the construction of a Hecke vector-form is to retrieve a transformation behavior analogous to the simpler, automor- phic case. In this way, a Hecke vector-form can be viewed as the vector function analogue of an automorphic form. Since our work is for any quasi- automorphic form over an arbitrary Hecke triangle group, we briefly review the construction of such groups. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the hauptmodul, the automorphic forms, and the normalized quasiautomor- phic form of weight 2 for any Hecke triangle group. We then proceed to the theory of Hecke vector-forms and establish the desired transformation be- havior with respect to the generators of the associated group. A proof of this fact is strictly elementary, relying on fine properties of binomial coefficients. Lastly, we relate the vector-forms to Hecke automorphic linear differential equations, which are analogues of the frequently researched modular linear differential equations. Our results include Hecke vector-forms of the classical quasimodular forms as the simplest case."}

Notably, this demonstrates for the first time that the contour integral method can be extended to the regularized setting (including the case $k_r=1$), thereby overcoming a limitation of previous approaches. Our results not only provide explicit parity relations at arbitrary depths but also lay the groundwork for extending this technique to other variants of multiple zeta values."}
