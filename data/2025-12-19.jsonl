In this paper we introduce areal Weil heights, which generalize the areal Mahler measure to the adelic setting. We use the framework of adelic heights established by Favre and Rivera-Letelier and we construct a $p$-adic analog for the area measure on a disk in $\\mathbb{C}$. For areal Weil heights we prove an analog of Kronecker's theorem, which characterizes their small points and essential minima. Furthermore, we determine equidistribution theorems for areal Weil heights. In some cases, they have a unique limiting distribution for small points, while in others there are infinitely many limiting distributions. We conclude with examples. In one of our examples, we determine for which radii $r$ there exist sequences of conjugate sets of algebraic integers which uniformly distribute to the disk $D(0,r) \\subset \\mathbb{C}$, and we compute the limiting height for such sequences."}
