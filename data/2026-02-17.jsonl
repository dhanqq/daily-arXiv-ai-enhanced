For a certain well-behaved class of representations, we explicitly parametrize candidates for these restriction properties and explain a technique to understand their deformations in complex families. We also give algebraic and geometric characterizations of the Chevalley restriction property which clarify how this perspective connects back to previous orbit-theoretic approaches. Finally, we utilize these restriction properties to prove explicit formulas for period integrals of some Calabi-Yau families. The key insight is that the restriction property on function fields can be leveraged to locally interpolate between the algebraic and analytic settings. Using this technique, we lift hypergeometric period formulas from subfamilies to obtain novel explicit formulas for periods of Calabi-Yau double covers of projective spaces and elliptic curves in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, expressed in terms of invariant functions on their parameter spaces."}

Under a precise nonresonance hypothesis, we establish a Poisson Poincaré--Dulac theorem: any logarithmic Poisson-flat connection with prescribed principal part is holomorphically gauge equivalent to a pure Euler--Poisson normal form with constant commuting residues, and this normal form is unique up to Casimir-valued gauge transformations lying in the common centralizer of the residues. To encode both leafwise transport and boundary winding, we construct a twisted leafwise fundamental groupoid via the real oriented blow-up and a 2-pushout that adjoins canonical tangential meridians.

In this way, we construct some new families of ordinary function fields and determine their full automorphism groups. Such groups are large with respect to the genus, compared with the known upper bounds on the size of the automorphism group of an ordinary function field."}

Suppose that the total space carries a Nakano semi-positive vector bundle, which is equivariant with respect to this action. We consider the relative canonical bundle twisted by this bundle. Under this setting, we prove that the logarithm of the equivariant analytic torsion of the regular fibers for this coefficient admits an asymptotic expansion near the discriminant locus. The leading term is given by a logarithmic singularity, while the subdominant term is given by a loglog-type singularity. In the non-equivariant case, we provide a formula for the coefficient of the leading term in terms of an integral of characteristic classes associated with the semi-stable reduction of the family. To establish these results, we prove the existence of an asymptotic expansion for both the equivariant Quillen metrics and the $L^{2}$-metrics in the above setting. We also calculate the leading term of the fiber integral of the Bott-Chern classes associated with the degeneration."}

Using Griffiths' formula for the infinitesimal invariant and higher Schiffer variations, we establish a numerical inequality relating the rank, the minimal support of a representing divisor and the modular dimension of the family. When the modular map is dominant, we obtain a sharp classification: equality occurs only for multiples of odd theta characteristics or of the canonical section. As applications, we derive geometric consequences for plane curves, obtaining results on intersections with very general quartic curves, in the spirit of the work of Chen-Riedl-Yeong, and with quintic curves."}

We compute the scheme-theoretic multiplicities of core Lagrangians, as well as the equivariant multiplicities of the very stable ones. Furthermore, we extend the notion of equivariant multiplicity to wobbly components and compute it for Hilbert schemes of two points. Inspired by Eisenstein series functor in Dolbeault Langlands correspondence, we propose that upward flows of very stable ideals are mirror dual to modified Procesi bundles, and justify this claim through numerical checks. Finally, we make some conjectures about extending this picture to wobbly upward flows."}

Young invariants in P_n get related to coordinate rings of general Segre embeddings of products of projective spaces; their bigraded Hilbert polynomials get expressed in terms of major-descent generating functions of words in multisets. Relations to the diagonal coinvariant algebra, cohomological interpretations including quantum cohomology, and Garsia-Stanton-style bases are also explored."}

This invariant q_C is a positive definite quadratic form attached to a smooth curve C of genus 2. It serves as a vital tool, as many geometric properties of C are reflected in the arithmetic properties of q_C. When the Jacobian J_C of a genus 2 curve C is isogenous to a product of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, the forms q_C have been completely classified recently. In this paper, building upon this classification, we present a constructive algorithm that produces J_C and a divisorial representative of a curve C of genus 2 such that its refined Humbert invariant q_C is equivalent to a given integral ternary quadratic form."}
