This conjecture is particularly interesting in that it subsumes and is stronger than both the Oppermann and Legrendre conjectures. Herein I shall verify Sierpinski's Hypothesis H1 for (at least) the first $n \\leq \\hbox{4 553 432 387} \\approx 4.5 \\hbox{ billion}$ of these Sierpinski matrices. I shall also demonstrate some partial but more general results. For example: Even for arbitrary $n\\geq \\hbox{4 553 432 388}$ at least one quarter of the rows of the $n$th Sierpinski matrix contain at least one prime.

Our comparison, a relative version of the work of Gorchinskiy, enhances his derived viewpoint on these biextensions. Especially when the family of varieties are smooth, the two constructions are related via derived regulator maps to Deligne cohomology, reinterpreted similarly to Beilinson's absolute Hodge cohomology, as well as the derived description of Hardouin's biextension that generalizes Poincaré line bundle by Hain. The comparison when the family defined over a smooth curve has a strongly semistable reduction further involves a simple monodromy computation using mixed Hodge modules.\n  Along our discussion, we simplify the discussion of Bloch and Seibold, partly in the style of Gorchinskiy.

It is known that its vanishing is closely related to ${\\bf Q}$-factoriality of $X$ in the rational singularity case with $n=3$. This number coincides with the dimension of the cokernel of the inclusion $H^{n-1}(X)\\to{\\rm IH}^{n-1}(X)$, the rank of the morphism from the vanishing cohomologies of $X$ to $H^{n+1}(X)$ for a one-parameter smoothing of $X$ with total space smooth, and also with the dimension of the unipotent monodromy part of the Milnor fiber cohomology of $f$ with degree $n$. In the case $X$ has only weighted homogeneous isolated singularities, the defect ${\\rm def}(X)$ is then given by the $E_2$-term of the spectral sequence of the double complex with differentials ${\\rm d}f\\wedge$ and $\\rm d$ by the $E_2$-degeneration of the pole order spectral sequence. It can be calculated explicitly using a computer even for analogues of the Hirzebruch quintic threefold with more than one hundred ordinary double points found by B.\\ van Geemen and J.\\ Werner in a compatible way with their computation. We give also an example with ${\\rm def}(X)>0$ and $|{\\rm Sing}\\,X|=1$ where $n=3$."}

Real numbers with irrationality exponent strictly greater than $2$ are transcendental numbers, and form a set with rich fractal structure.

As a corollary, we show that the set of irrationals whose irrationality exponents are strictly bigger than $2$ and whose backward continued fraction expansions have bounded partial quotients is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. This is a sharp contrast to the fact that there exists no irrational whose irrationality exponent is strictly greater than $2$ and whose regular continued fraction expansion has bounded partial quotients."}

The theorem is motivated by recent conjectures and their proof strategy by Gao and Zhang on the Northcott property of the Beilinson--Bloch height pairing. Our method involves a homological algebra interpretation of the Archimedean height by Hain. This interpretation allows us to introduce motivic viewpoints using Deligne cohomology, cycle class maps and higher Chow groups.\n  Especially, we compare the biextension by Hain and Brosnan--Pearlstein over $\\mathbb{C}$ based on Poincaré line bundle and Hodge theory with the $\\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}}$-biextension of Bloch and Seibold defined by two families of homologically trivial cycles on a generically smooth family of projective varieties over a smooth curve. Our comparison, a relative version of the work of Gorchinskiy, enhances his derived viewpoint on these biextensions. Especially when the family of varieties are smooth, the two constructions are related via derived regulator maps to Deligne cohomology, reinterpreted similarly to Beilinson's absolute Hodge cohomology, as well as the derived description of Hardouin's biextension that generalizes Poincaré line bundle by Hain. The comparison when the family defined over a smooth curve has a strongly semistable reduction further involves a simple monodromy computation using mixed Hodge modules.\n  Along our discussion, we simplify the discussion of Bloch and Seibold, partly in the style of Gorchinskiy. For example, the symmetry of their biextension is proved more easily than their work."}
