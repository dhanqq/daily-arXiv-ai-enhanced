We say that $f(x)$ is monogenic if $\\mathbb{Z}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[θ]$. A polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is called reciprocal if $f(x) = x^{\\operatorname{deg}(f)} f(1/x)$. In this article, we derive sufficient conditions for the monogeneity of even degree reciprocal polynomials. By employing properties of the discriminant of reciprocal polynomials, we partially prove a conjecture proposed by Jones in $2021$. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound on the number of certain sextic monogenic reciprocal polynomials."}

They are easy to implement numerically, using only polynomial and power functions, and are efficient for obtaining dozens or hundreds of digits (when the imaginary part is not too large). They may prove less suited to very high precision (tens of thousands of digits), due to a linear cost for each new term. One can express the coefficients as linear combinations of Bernoulli numbers, but this is not advantageous numerically. The method is a development of tools introduced by the author for the evaluation of harmonic series with restricted digits in a given radix."}
