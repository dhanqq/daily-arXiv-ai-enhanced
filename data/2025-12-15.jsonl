Our approach employs the Lauricella system of type D for hypergeometric series in $2g-1$ variables, whose truncations (up to scalar multiplication) give the entries of a Cartier-Manin matrix. The multiplicity-one theorem is obtained through an analysis of equalities involving partial derivatives of these entries."}

For an ideal $I \\subset \\mathcal{E}(Ω)$, we denote by $Z(I)$ its zero set. A classical result of René Thom asserts that if $I$ is a finitely generated Łojasiewicz ideal, then $Z(I)$ contains an open dense subset of smooth points. The goal of this note is to examine a converse question: does the existence of an open dense set of smooth points in $Z(I)$ ( $I\\subset\\mathcal{E}(Ω) $ is a finitely generated ideal) imply that the ideal $I$ is Łojasiewicz? We analyze obstructions to such a converse and identify geometric conditions under which it fails.\n  As an application, we study smooth real-valued functions of two variables whose zero set coincides with the classical Hawaiian earring, the union of infinitely many tangent circles accumulating at the origin. We show that any such function must be flat at the origin, in the sense that all partial derivatives vanish there. We formulate a geometric criterion concerning families of smooth arcs tangent at a point with unbounded or infinitely varying curvature, and derive from it a degenerate form of the Łojasiewicz inequality adapted to this non-analytic setting."}

In particular, we provide a complete methodology to compute the $p$-adic continued fraction of the Möbius transformation and the bilinear fractional transformation of $p$-adic numbers. These allow any standard arithmetic operation over $p$-adic numbers to be performed. In great contrast with real continued fractions, we prove that the knowledge of arbitrarily many partial quotients of the initial continued fractions is not always sufficient to recover some partial quotients of the transformations.

For a log smooth scheme $X$ over $S,$ we obtain, under the assumption that the exact relative Frobenius lifts to the Witt vectors, a fully faithful functor from the category of quasi-coherent modules on the base change $X'=X\\times_{S,F_S}S$ of $X$ by the Frobenius $F_S$ of $S,$ equipped with a quasi-nilpotent Higgs field, to the category of quasi-coherent modules on $X$ equipped with a quasi-nilpotent integrable connection.

To address this issue, we refine the topoi and crystals mentioned above by endowing them with an indexed structure, inspired by Lorenzon's extension of Cartier descent to smooth logarithmic schemes. Using the Azumaya property of the ring of logarithmic differential operators, we then obtain an equivalence between the corresponding categories of indexed crystals, thereby generalizing the Cartier transform."}
