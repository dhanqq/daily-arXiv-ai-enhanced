We reinterpret this picture via Isbell duality: viewing $M$ as an $Rbar$-enriched profunctor $M$: $C^{op}\\otimes D\\to Rbar$, we study the associated order-reversing Isbell adjunction $M^*\\dashv M_*$ and its fixed-point locus, the nucleus $Nuc(M)$. After projectivization, $pnuc(M)$ carries two interacting geometries. On the metric side, $Rbar$-enrichment induces a canonical Hilbert projective--type (max-spread) metric on projective (co)presheaves, and we show that the projective Isbell maps identify the presheaf and copresheaf realizations of $pnuc(M)$ by mutually inverse isometries. On the polyhedral side, in the discrete real setting the Isbell inequalities cut out a canonical polyhedral decomposition of $pnuc(M)$ recovering the usual tropical cell structure. Our main new ingredient is a pointwise invariant of a nucleus point $(f,g)$: the nonnegative $\\textit{gap matrix}$ $δ^{(f,g)}(c,d)=M(c,d)-f(c)-g(d)$. Its zero pattern determines the cell containing $(f,g)$, while its positive entries compute exact metric distances to the boundary strata where additional inequalities become tight (Events Theorem). This distance-to-wall principle refines cells into order chambers and supports a constructible tower of complete lattices obtained by thresholding $δ^{(f,g)}$."}

Katz proved the Grothendieck-Katz $p$-curvature conjecture for the Gauss-Manin connection on the $i$-th cohomology of $X/S$: if its $p$-curvature vanishes mod $p$ for infinitely many $p$, then the action of $π_1(S,s)$ on $H^i(X_s, \\mathbb{Z})$ factors through a finite group. We prove a non-abelian analogue of this statement: if the $p$-curvature of the isomonodromy foliation on the moduli of flat bundles of rank $r$ on $X/S$ vanishes mod $p$ for infinitely many $p$, then the action of $π_1(S,s)$ on the rank $r$ integral characters of $π_1(X_s)$ factors through a finite group. We deduce many new cases of the Bost/Ekedahl--Shepherd-Barron--Taylor conjecture.\n  The proofs rely on a non-abelian version of Katz's formula, and a non-abelian version of the Hodge index theorem."}

The resulting Clemens complex is more complicated than usual, and leads to particularly interesting effective cone constants, associated with exponentially many polytopes whose volumes appear in the expected formula. Like a jigsaw puzzle, these polytopes fit together to one large polytope. The volume of this polytope appears in the asymptotic formula that we obtain using the universal torsor method via o-minimal structures."}
