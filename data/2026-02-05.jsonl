The paper begins with a detailed description of what we know about the Riemann zeta function and its zeros, followed by an extensive survey of mathematical theories developed in pursuit of RH -- from classical analytic approaches to modern geometric and physical methods. We also discuss several equivalent formulations of the hypothesis. Within this survey framework, we present an original contribution in the form of a \"Letter to Riemann,\" using only mathematics available in his time. This letter reveals a method inspired by Riemann's own approach to the conformal mapping theorem: by extremizing a quadratic form (restriction of Weil's quadratic form in modern language), we obtain remarkable approximations to the zeros of zeta. Using only primes less than 13, this optimization procedure yields approximations to the first 50 zeros with accuracies ranging from $2.6 \\times 10^{-55}$ to $10^{-3}$. Moreover we prove a general result that these approximating values lie exactly on the critical line. Following the letter, we explain the underlying mathematics in modern terms, including the description of a deep connection of the Weil quadratic form with the world of information theory. The final sections develop a geometric perspective using trace formulas, outlining a potential proof strategy based on establishing convergence of zeros from finite to infinite Euler products. While completing the commissioned survey, these new results suggest a promising direction for future research on Riemann's conjecture."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Twisted $L$-functions by Dirichlet characters offer deep insights into arithmetic geometry, especially in the study of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over number fields. In the function field setting, Drinfeld modules and Anderson modules serve as analogues of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, and Goss $L$-series play the role of Hasse-Weil $L$-functions. This paper introduces a motivic framework for studying twisted Goss $L$-series via Anderson motives associated to Drinfeld modules and Artin representations.\n  For a Drinfeld module and an Artin representation on the absolute Galois group, we present a construction of Anderson motives associated to them and we show that it comes from a uniformizable abelian Anderson module. We also study their associated $L$-series, which recover the norm of the twisted Goss $L$-values. These results provide an interpretation of twisted Goss $L$-values in terms of regulators of Anderson modules with the help of Taelman's class number formula."}

Based on recent developments in the Kähler minimal model program, for flat families with fiberwise canonical singularities, we establish the global stability of the pseudo-effectivity of canonical divisors, assuming in addition that one fiber is projective, while the same conclusion for Kähler threefolds is also true without the projectivity assumption of the central fiber. For smooth Kähler families whose central fiber is projective with a big adjoint class, we show that its volume remains locally constant. Finally, using the (relative) minimal model program for Kähler threefolds, we verify the deformation invariance of volumes of adjoint classes and plurigenera for smooth families of Kähler threefolds, thereby confirming Siu's invariance of plurigenera conjecture in dimension three."}
