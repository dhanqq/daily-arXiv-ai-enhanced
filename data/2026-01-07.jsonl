In this paper, we study their geometric properties and show that they behave like universally deformed Nakajima quiver varieties. Based on this, we provide a new proof of the existence of critical stable envelopes on them. Following an idea of Nakajima, we give a sheaf theoretic interpretation of critical stable envelopes by the hyperbolic restriction in the affinization of symmetric quiver varieties. The associativity of hyperbolic restrictions implies the triangle lemma of critical stable envelopes."}

The second purpose is to show that the $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_p$-fibers of the special Newton polygon map behave like formal schemes, and in particular, satisfy henselianity properties with respect to their reduced locus. These two goals achieved in this article are two of the crucial ingredients used in our collaboration with Hamman, Ivanov, Lourenço and Zou to construct the equivalence that compares the schematic and analytic local Langlands categories of Zhu and of Fargues--Scholze. To achieve these goals, we introduce and study spatial kimberlites, which is a better behaved variant of the theory previously developed by the author."}

As an application, we prove that all quasi-smooth weighted Fano hypersurfaces of index 1 with at most two weights greater than 1 are K-stable. We also construct several examples of K-unstable quasi-smooth weighted Fano hypersurfaces of low indices. To prove these results, we establish lower bounds for stability thresholds using the method of Abban-Zhuang, which reduces the problem to lower-dimensional cases. A key feature of our approach is the use of plt flags that are not necessarily admissible."}

In this paper, we extend the concept of polynomial-type exceptional units to the ring of integers of an arbitrary algebraic number field. We investigate the number of these polynomial-type exceptional units on general algebraic varieties. By employing the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Hensel's lifting technique, we derive an exact counting formula for the number of these exceptional units on a smooth closed subscheme under the assumption of good reduction. Furthermore, using the Lang-Weil inequality, we establish an asymptotic estimate for the counting function. In particular, we prove that for varieties of degree at most two, the error term can be significantly improved, yielding a sharper asymptotic bound."}

In this article, we establish many such Ramaswami and Apostol type translation formulae for the Dirichlet series defining the polylogarithm functions. This extended set up has many interesting applications, for example, it allows us to also find some (seemingly new) recurrence relations between the Bernoulli numbers, and use them to deduce some congruence properties of the tangent numbers."}

We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})^3\\backslash\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates."}
