Submitted to the 17th Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium", "summary": "We define two new problems called SIAP and CAP related to solving SIVP and CVP in a subset of lattices called Simultaneous Approximation (SA) lattices. We give dimension- and gap-preserving, deterministic polynomial-time and space reductions from SVP$_γ$, SIVP$_γ$, and CVP$_γ$ to their corresponding problems in SA lattices. These reductions show that instances of these problems in SA lattices are just as hard as general instances and thus are interesting new problems to consider for use in cryptography. We also show that the reductions are optimal in regards to integer inflation."}

Here, we review Legendre's conjecture on primes between consecutive squares and recent progress on the weaker question of primes between consecutive larger powers. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis (RH), we observe that a recent result of Emanuel Carneiro, Micah Milinovich and Kannan Soundararajan, combined with a large-scale computation by Jonathan Sorenson and Jonathan Webster, implies the existence of primes between $x^{2+δ}$ and $(x+1)^{2+δ}$ for all real $x \\geq 1$ when $δ\\geq 1/4$. For smaller values of $δ> 0$, we provide an explicit bound $x_0 = x_0 (δ)$ such that primes exist in these intervals whenever $x \\geq x_0$ (again assuming RH). We conclude with an application to Mills-type prime-generating constants."}

We show that their main results admit short conceptual proofs, avoiding any restriction on the dimension and the Picard number, from the general theory of Cox rings and Mori Dream Spaces, once one organizes small $\\mathbb Q$-factorial modifications via the GKZ (secondary fan) decomposition of the moving cone. Moreover, we extend this viewpoint beyond the toric case by proving an analogous statement for complete $\\mathbb Q$-factorial weak Mori Dream Spaces: any non-projective such variety admits a divisor $D$ and a $D$-flip to a (projective) Mori Dream Space. Our approach highlights the role of chambers and wall-crossing in the secondary fan as a unifying framework for these constructions."}
