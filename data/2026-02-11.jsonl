Our approach has three parts involving distinct techniques: (1) a formal splitting theorem for regular or analytic functions which satisfy a generic splitting hypothesis; (2) a study of singularities in the closure of the normal crossings locus, based on the combinatorics of G-circulant matrices, where G is a finite abelian group, leading to a theorem on reduction to group-circulant normal form; (3) a partial desingularization theorem, proved using (1) and (2) together with weighted blowings-up of group-circulant singularities. Previous results were for partial desingularization preserving simple normal crossings, or preserving general normal crossings when dim X < 5."}
