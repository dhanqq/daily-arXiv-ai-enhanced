Specifically, we consider Laurent polynomials in the positive orthant with fixed support and fixed coefficient signs. We provide a criterion to decide whether a given polynomial is copositive that is based in determining the intersection points of the signed discriminant and a path going through the coefficients of the polynomial. If the signed support satisfies a combinatorial condition termed nonseparability, we show additionally that this intersection consists of one point, and that tracking one path in homotopy continuation methods suffices to decide upon copositivity.\n  Building on these results, we show that any copositive polynomial with nonseparable signed support can be decomposed into a sum of nonnegative circuit polynomials, generalising thereby previously known supports having this property."}

Our method builds on previous algorithms from chemical reaction network theory and reduces the question to checking the feasibility of a linear system of equalities and inequalities. Our criterion provides a sufficient condition for the absence of multiple positive zeros that applies to any augmented vertically parametrized polynomial system, and we show that when the kernel of the coefficient matrix of the system displays a certain sparsity structure, this condition becomes also necessary. We give thereby a full characterization of the existence of multiple zeros for this type of systems."}
