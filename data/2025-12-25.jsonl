For real-valued G-additive functions (additive in the greedy G-digits), we establish an Erdős-Wintner-type theorem: convergence of two canonical series (a first-moment series and a quadratic digit-energy series) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a limiting distribution along initial segments of the integers. In that case, the limiting characteristic function admits an explicit infinite-product factorization whose local factors depend only on the underlying digit system. We also indicate conditional extensions of this two-series criterion to Ostrowski numeration systems with bounded partial quotients and to Parry $β$-expansions with Pisot-Vijayaraghavan base $β$."}

While explicit moduli descriptions of X_1(N) are well developed, a comparable construction for X_0(N) has remained incomplete. We give a uniform method for constructing explicit generators of C(X_0(N)), extending an approach of Dowd, and use them to obtain a concrete moduli interpretation of cyclic N-isogenies. This yields explicit formulas for sporadic rational points on X_0(N) and the associated isogenies, providing a unified solution to the moduli problem for X_0(N)."}

Unlike the previous approaches in the residually irreducible case from Gouvêa-Mazur, Böckle and Allen, our method relies on local-global compatibility results, potential pro-modularity arguments and a non-ordinary finiteness result between the local deformation ring at $p$ and the global deformation ring. This allows us to construct sufficiently many non-ordinary regular de Rham points whose modularity is guaranteed by the recent progress on the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. Also, we will discuss some applications of our main results, including the equidimensionality of certain big Hecke algebras and big $R=\\mathbb{T}$ theorems in the residually reducible case."}

By previous work with Chen-Möller-Zagier, this definition agrees with the Masur-Veech volumes in the holomorphic case. We show that these algebraic constants can be computed by induction on the genus and number of singularities. Besides, for strata with a single zero, we prove that the generating series of these volumes is a solution of an integrable system associated with the PDE: $u_tu_{xx}=u_tu_x+u_t - 1$."}

Focusing on shallow networks with two neurons, quadratic activation, and scalar output, we identify the associated neurovariety with the second secant variety of a quadratic Veronese embedding. We introduce and analyze the virtual Euclidean Distance degree, a projective invariant defined as the sum of the polar degrees of the variety, which coincides with the usual Euclidean Distance degree for a generic choice of scalar product. Using intersection theory, Chern-Mather classes, and the Nash blow-up provided by Kempf's resolution, we reduce the computation of the virtual Euclidean Distance degree to explicit intersection numbers on a Grassmannian. Applying equivariant localization, we prove that this invariant depends stably polynomially on the input dimension. Numerical experiments based on homotopy continuation illustrate the dependence of the Euclidean Distance degree on the chosen metric and highlight the distinction between the generic and nongeneric cases, such as the Bombieri-Weyl metric."}

This scenario arises in machine learning when the dataset size is small with respect to the model, and is typically referred to as overparametrization. Our main result relates the degenerate optimization problem to a nondegenerate one via a projection. In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection. Additionally, we provide tools for counting the number of critical points over projective varieties, and discuss specific cases arising from deep learning. Our work bridges tools from algebraic geometry with ideas from machine learning, and it extends the line of literature around the Euclidean distance degree to the degenerate setting."}

We establish the Chevalley-Weil formula for pluricanonical representations of a curve with a finite group action and a decomposition theorem for pluricanonical systems of abelian covers. These tools allow an explicit study of geometric properties of $X$, such as base loci and the birationality of pluricanonical maps. For threefolds isogenous to a product, we prove that the 4-canonical map is birational for $p_g \\ge 5$ and construct an example attaining the maximal canonical degree for this class of threefolds. In this example, the canonical map is the normalization of its image, which admits isolated non-normal singularities. Computational classifications also reveal threefolds where the bicanonical map fails to be birational, even in the absence of genus-2 fibrations. This illustrates an interesting phenomenon similar to the non-standard case for surfaces."}
