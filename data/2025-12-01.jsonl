Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of abelian number fields with $p$-power Galois group. For an elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{Q}$, we study the Mazur-Tate elements over the finite layers of the cyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ and $L$. We show that the vanishing of the $μ$-invariant is preserved in the extension: if the level-$n$ Mazur-Tate element over $K$ has $μ= 0$, then the corresponding element over $L$ also has $μ= 0$. Moreover, the associated $λ$-invariants satisfy an explicit transition formula. This parallels the work of Hachimori-Matsuno on Selmer groups and of Matsuno on $p$-adic $L$-functions. As an application, we obtain an analogue of Kida's formula for the analytic Iwasawa invariants associated to Pollack's signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. Since our results apply to elliptic curves with any reduction type at $p$ under mild hypotheses, including those with additive reduction, we also obtain a Kida-type formula for the $p$-adic $L$-functions constructed by Delbourgo for elliptic curves with unstable additive reduction. In particular, because Mazur-Tate elements approximate $p$-adic $L$-functions in the limit, our results unify all previously known cases of Kida's formula for analytic Iwasawa invariants."}

Progress toward this conjecture has been made by studying the connectedness of the graphs obtained from the action of the Vieta group on the nonzero mod $p$ solutions to the Markoff equation. In this paper, we use results on Pisano periods of the Fibonacci sequence to obtain explicit results on the connectedness of special points in this graph for primes $p$ where $p+1$ has large $2$-adic valuation. In particular, for Mersenne primes $p \\equiv \\pm 2 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 5)$, we show that the special point $(1, 1, 1)$ which is fixed under reduction modulo $p$ lies in a component of this graph which is known to be connected."}

We also reconstruct a series of \"twisted fundamental groupoids\" whose representations correspond to meromorphic flat connections on the complex affine line with logarithmic or irregular singularities at the origin."}

In this paper we establish sufficient conditions for families of analytic function-germs on a germ of a complex analytic space to admit an embedded topological trivialization. Our results extend previous work of the third author and collaborators, moving from abstract triviality to the embedded setting. As an application, we obtain new instances of topological stability, including a broad class of $μ$-constant deformations. These findings provide a new insight into the long-standing $μ$-constant conjecture, one of the major open problems in the field."}

Among their compactifications, there is a toric compactification that generalizes the standard Losev-Manin compactification to this higher-dimensional setting. Our main result identifies the fan of this toric compactification as a symmetric product of a nested fan, generalizing the classical connection between Losev-Manin spaces and the permutohedron to arbitrary dimension. More generally, we prove that the fans of all Gallardo-Routis compactifications that admit reduction maps from this Losev-Manin space are symmetric products of building sets. This shows that the combinatorics of these compactifications are controlled by coarsenings of the permutohedral fan that give rise to Hassett spaces."}
