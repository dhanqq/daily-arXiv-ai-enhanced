As a corollary, we give a closed form expressions of the power series $\\sum_{n\\geq 0}\\operatorname{spt}(\\ell n-δ_{\\ell})q^n\\pmod{\\ell}$, $δ_{\\ell}:=(\\ell^2-1)/24$, by Hecke traces for weight $\\ell+1 $ cusp forms on $\\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.

Chudnovsky and for E-functions (and, more generally, for holonomic arithmetic Gevrey series) by Y. Andr{é}. Our approach is based on a preliminary study of independent interest of the nature of the solutions of Mahler equations. Roughly speaking, we prove a reduction result for Mahler systems, implying that any Mahler equation admits a complete basis of solutions formed of what we call generalized Mahler series. These are sums involving Puiseux series, Hahn series of a very special type and solutions of inhomogeneous equations of order 1 with constant coefficients. In the light of B. Adamczewski, J. P. Bell and D. Smertnig's recent height gap theorem, we introduce a natural filtration on the set of generalized Mahler series according to the arithmetic growth of the coefficients of the Puiseux series involved in their decomposition. This filtration has five pieces. Our purity theorem states that the membership of a generalized Mahler series to one of the three largest pieces of this filtration propagates to any other generalized Mahler series solution of its minimal Mahler equation. We also show that this statement does not extend to the smallest two pieces."}

The modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ parameterizes elliptic curves with $p$-torsion modules anti-symplectically isomorphic to $E[p]$. The work of Freitas--Naskręcki--Stoll uses the modular method to show that all primitive non-trivial solutions of the Fermat-type equation $x^2 + y^3 = z^p$ give rise to rational points on $X_E^-(p)$ with $E \\in \\{27a1,54a1,96a1,288a1,864a1,864b1,864c1 \\}$. Using a criterion classifying the existence of local points due to the first two authors, we show that, for $E$ any of the curves with conductor 864 and certain primes $p \\equiv 19 \\pmod{24}$, we have $X_E^-(p)(\\mathbb Q_\\ell) = \\emptyset$. Furthermore, for each $E$ in the list and any $p$, we prove that either $X_E^-(p)$ can be discarded using the same criterion, or it cannot be discarded using purely local information."}

We give applications to hyperplane arrangements, describing in a uniform effective manner the Chen ranks of the fundamental group of the complement of every arrangement whose projective resonance is reduced. Finally, we formulate a sharp generic vanishing conjecture for Koszul modules and present a parallel between this statement and the Prym--Green Conjecture on syzygies of general Prym canonical curves."}
