Likewise, Ramanujan's mock theta functions, originally introduced in his last letter to Hardy, have inspired generations of mathematicians to work on $q$-series and modular forms. In this work, we establish several new identities connecting Ramanujan's continued fractions of order twenty. By employing product representation for Jacobi's theta function $θ_1$, we derive a family of new relations connecting the continued fractions of order twenty with continued fractions of order ten and Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction. Further, by expressing Eisenstein series in terms of Lambert series and utilizing certain mock theta functions and their logarithmic derivatives, we obtain beautiful relations between Eisenstein series and theta functions of level twenty. Using Ramanujan's $_1 ψ_1$ summation formula, we establish Eisenstein series identities associated with the continued fractions of order twenty. These results extend earlier work on continued fractions of order 6, 12, and 16 and contribute to theory of $q$-series."}

Solving this problem is an essential step in several recent deterministic algorithms for factoring $N$, including the currently fastest ones. In 2018, the second author gave an algorithm that for a given target order $D \\geq N^{2/5}$, finds either an element of order exceeding $D$, or a nontrivial divisor of $N$, or proves that $N$ is prime. The running time was \\[ O\\left(\\frac{D^{1/2}}{(\\log \\log D)^{1/2}} \\log^2 N \\right) \\] bit operations, asymptotically the same as the cost of computing the order of a single element using Sutherland's optimisation of the classical babystep-giantstep method. Subsequent work by several authors weakened the hypothesis $D \\geq N^{2/5}$ to $D \\geq N^{1/6}$. In this paper, we show that the hypothesis may be dropped altogether. Moreover, if $N$ is prime, we can guarantee returning an element of order exceeding $D$, rather than a proof that $N$ is prime."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "A main conjecture in the field of Positive Geometry states that amplituhedra are positive geometries. It is motivated by examples showing that the canonical forms of certain amplituhedra compute scattering amplitudes in particle physics. In recent work, Brown and Dupont introduced a new framework, based on mixed Hodge theory, connecting canonical forms and de Rham cohomology. In this paper, we show that this framework is consistent with the known results for amplituhedra but does not apply beyond those families. We provide an explicit example showing that the central assumption of the Brown-Dupont framework (namely to have a pair of genus zero) is not a necessary condition to be a positive geometry in the original sense of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, and Lam. This underscores the fact that our results do not immediately disqualify the amplituhedron from being a positive geometry."}

Building on Bombieri's and Van der Poorten's explicit formula for continued-fraction coefficients of algebraic numbers (specialized to cubic roots) we derive an effective bound for a Roth-type constant assuming an effective form of ABC. Roth's original argument establishes existence but does not yield an explicit value; our approach makes the dependence on the ABC parameters explicit and also gives an explicit bound in the corresponding special case of Ridout's theorem. We then introduce the notion of approximation gain as a refinement of the quality of an abc-triple. For c in a large computational range, the approximation gain remains below a strikingly small threshold, motivating the conjecture that the approximation gain is always smaller than 1.5. This suggests a potential strategy for attacking ABC by bounding approximation gain and power gain separately."}
