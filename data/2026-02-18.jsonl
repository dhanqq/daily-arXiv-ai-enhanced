Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We study tensor network varieties associated with the triangular graph, with a focus on the case where one of the physical dimensions is 2. This allows us to interpret the tensors as pencils of matrices. We provide a complete characterization of these varieties in terms of the Kronecker invariants of pencils. We determine their dimension, identifying the cases for which the dimension is smaller than the expected parameter count. We provide necessary conditions for membership in these varieties, in terms of the geometry of classical determinantal varieties, coincident root loci and plane cubic curves. We address some extensions to arbitrary graphs."}

We describe all singular fibers of the Hitchin map, including the nilpotent cone. To achieve this, we consider a modular map that lifts Higgs bundles with five poles on the Riemann sphere to Higgs bundles on the elliptic curve. This map is a two-sheeted covering and we analyze its Galois involution. We prove that the modular map is surjective and determine its ramification locus. In particular, we also obtain an explicit description of the singular locus of the moduli space."}

The invariant, that we call the multiplicity sequence of $V$, takes into account the multiplicities of the successive discriminants of $V$ by generic corank one projections."}

Based on explicit computations, we conjecture that every such eigenform $f$ admits a twin to which it is congruent modulo a surprisingly high power of $p$, whose exponent is close to the opposite of the valuation of the $\\mathcal L$-invariant of $f$, and whose Atkin--Lehner sign is opposite to that of $f$. This is a new phenomenon that is not explained by the known results on the $p$-adic variation of eigenforms. Inspired by the global picture, we formulate a local conjecture describing congruences between semistable representations of fixed weight, varying $\\mathcal L$-invariant, and opposite Atkin--Lehner signs. We give some theoretical evidence towards our conjectures."}
