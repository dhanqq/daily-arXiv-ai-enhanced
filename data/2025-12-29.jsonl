Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$ and were obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. We also consider situations with singular biquadratics. Further, we establish a new two-way relationship between \\emph{diagonal} random walks in the quarter plane and $4$-bar links.

We introduce \\emph{$k$ semi-periodicity} as a novel and natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing new objects, \\emph{the secondary $(2-2)$-correspondence} and the related \\emph{secondary cubic} of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form."}
