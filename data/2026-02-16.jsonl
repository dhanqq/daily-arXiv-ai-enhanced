Furthermore, taking the Zariski closure, we define and study varieties of spline signature tensors. We determine dimension and degree of these tensor varieties in a number of examples, relying on symbolic computations. With a view towards learning, constructing paths with a given signature tensor translates to studying the fibers of the signature map. We use computational methods to determine their cardinality, with a focus on its dependence on different classes of splines. We observe in explicit examples that reconstructing splines from a given signature tensor of a path yields close approximations of the original path."}
