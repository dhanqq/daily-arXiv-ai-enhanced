Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A. Singh arises as a special case of our theory."}

In particular, if $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} a_{k+1}/a_k = η> 1$ for some transcendental number $η$, we prove that for every $m\\in \\mathbb N$ the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ is asymptotically equivalent to the $m$-th cumulant of the ``independent model'' $\\widetilde{S}_n := \\sum_{k=1}^n \\cos (2 πa_k U_k)$, where $U_1, U_2, \\dots$ are independent random variables having uniform distribution on $[0,1]$.

For instance, for $a_k = 2^k+1$ (with $η= 2$), the sixth cumulant of $S_n$ grows quadratically in $n$. In contrast, for $a_k = 2^k$ (again $η= 2$) or when $(a_k)_{k \\geq 1}$ is the Fibonacci sequence (with $η= (1+\\sqrt 5)/2$), the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ grows linearly as $n\\to\\infty$, but with a growth rate that differs from the one of the independent model $\\widetilde{S}_n$. Overall, our results show that the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums depends on arithmetic effects in a very delicate way. This is particularly remarkable since many other probabilistic limit theorems, such as the Central Limit Theorem, hold for lacunary trigonometric sums in a universal way without any such sensitivity towards arithmetic effects."}
