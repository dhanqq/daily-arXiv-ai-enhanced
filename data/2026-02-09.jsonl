In this paper, we establish asymptotic formulas and upper bounds for the mean square values of Hurwitz-type and Barnes-type multiple zeta functions. In particular, we focus on the Hurwitz-type case, since Hurwitz multiple zeta functions can be expressed as linear combinations of the classical Hurwitz zeta function, which allows us to apply known results on the mean values and asymptotic behavior of the latter almost directly. Moreover, it can be shown that Hurwitz-type and Barnes-type multiple zeta functions have the same order under certain conditions. This fact enables us to investigate the mean values and growth of Barnes multiple zeta functions, which are otherwise difficult to evaluate, by using the results for Hurwitz multiple zeta functions."}

Such a formula should be useful for studying the automorphic spectrum of these symmetric spaces and the deep links between linear periods and special values of standard $L$-functions at their center of symmetry. Indeed, our formula yields an identity between spectral distributions, which generalize relative characters built on linear periods, and geometric distributions, which are an extension of relative orbital integrals. We show that the spectral distributions are, in a certain sense, asymptotic to truncated integrals of the components of the automorphic kernel associated with a cuspidal datum: this provides a handle on these distributions and has allowed, in a companion paper, to express some of these distributions in the form of a weighted relative character. The geometric distributions attached to \"regular semi-simple\" geometric data are expressed as weighted relative orbital integrals. In general, for non-regular geometric data, we introduce a procedure of descent to the centralizer, which allows us to express any geometric distribution in terms of the nilpotent contribution of infinitesimal trace formulas studied in previous papers."}

In characteristic zero, the problem was solved by Hironaka in 1964, work for which he was awarded the Fields Medal. Modern proofs proceed by constructing suitable ranking functions, that is, invariants shown to strictly decrease along canonical sequences of blow-ups, ensuring termination. In positive characteristic, however, no such general ranking function is known: Frobenius-specific pathologies, such as the kangaroo phenomenon, can cause classical characteristic-zero invariants to plateau or even temporarily increase, presenting a fundamental obstruction to existing approaches. In this paper we report a sequence of experiments using the evolutionary search model AlphaEvolve, designed to discover candidate ranking functions for a toy canonical blow-up process. Our test benchmarks consist of carefully selected hypersurface singularities in dimension $4$ and characteristic $p=3$, with monic purely inseparable leading term, a regime in which naive order-based invariants often fail. After iteratively refining the experimental design, we obtained a discretized five-component lexicographic ranking function satisfying a bounded-delay descent criterion with zero violations across the benchmark. These experiments in turn motivated our main results: the conjectural delayed ranking functions in characteristic $3$ formulated in two conjectures."}

In each of the five cases, there is a natural group action on the underlying space with a unique polynomial invariant called the discriminant, and a notion of projectivity for the elements of the space. The strategy behind Bhargava's approach is to construct a discriminant-preserving bijection between the set of orbits under the group action and the set of (tuples of) suitable ideal classes of quadratic rings. The projective ideal classes are equipped with a natural group structure and hence we get a group structure on the spaces of equivalence classes of projective forms of fixed discriminant $D$.
