This yields infinite families of monogenic polynomials of arbitrary degree, including families with a non-square-free discriminant.

To address this, we introduce the use of relevant subsets $B \\subseteq S_+$ (where $S_+$ is the ideal generated by all relevant elements), $B \\unlhd S$, which allow us to control this condition more flexibly.\n  As an application, we show that multigraded noetherian polynomial rings naturally encode combinatorial data, giving rise to systems of fans and thus to toric prevarieties. By leveraging our notion of rational maps with those relevant subsets, we prove that the category of triples $(D, S, B)$ - where $D$ is a finitely generated abelian group, $S$ is a $D$-graded noetherian polynomial ring, and $B \\unlhd S$ is a subset of $S_+$ - together with rational maps of conical rings, is anti-equivalent to the category of simplicial toric prevarieties."}

They expressed the generating functions of $SOME(n)$ and $DSOME(n)$ in terms of $q$-series and found several interesting congruences modulo 4 and 5. In this paper, we express the generating function of $DSOME(n)$ in a closed form, which allows us to find some new congruences and internal congruences modulo 4 and 8 for $DSOME(n)$."}

We introduce and analyze the fundamental function \\(F_{x,t}^{(k)}(n) = t^2(kx-n)^2 - 2nxt\\), whose perfect square values are equivalent to solutions of the conjectures.\n  For any fixed pair \\((x,t)\\), we define its admissible domain \\(\\mathcal{D}_{x,t}^{(k)}\\) and prove that on this domain, \\(F\\) is strictly decreasing, non-negative, and converges to its minimum. A key result is the Zero Lemma: if \\(F(n_0)=0\\) for some \\(n_0\\) in the domain, then \\(n_0\\) is necessarily the upper bound of \\(\\mathcal{D}_{x,t}^{(k)}\\), and such zeros of \\(F\\) yield explicit symmetric solutions with \\(y=z\\).\n  As an illustration, in the classical Erdős--Straus case (\\(k=4\\)), we explicitly construct symmetric solutions \\(y = z\\) for all integers \\(n \\equiv 0,2,3 \\pmod{4}\\), covering already \\(75\\%\\) of all integers. For the remaining class \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\), which is traditionally more challenging, we construct explicit symmetric solutions based on the existence of a divisor \\(b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\\), and we show that this condition is satisfied for almost all such integers: the set of exceptions has natural density zero.\n  Consequently, the Erdős--Straus conjecture is verified for a proportion of integers tending to \\(1\\) in this class. In particular, we obtain infinitely many new explicit families of symmetric solutions for numbers not covered by Mordell's theorem. These results elucidate the structural behavior of \\(F\\) and provide a unified framework for generating large families of solutions."}
