At each step, a pointer read from the working sequence designates which element to remove. Applied to the natural numbers, the sieve is governed by the golden ratio and recovers the Wythoff partition. We develop the theory of the golden sieve on arithmetic progressions and reveal new structural properties. The survivor sequence is a hiccup sequence in the sense of Fokkink and Joshi, whose gaps take exactly two consecutive values, selected by a rule that depends on the sequence itself. The resulting partition satisfies a Fraenkel-type complementary equation, and the gap word is Sturmian in the base case. A double sieve variant, where both pointer and target are removed at each step, yields three-way partitions of the integers. On perfect squares, the hiccup rule becomes doubly self-referential: the gap at step $n$ is controlled by whether $n$ is the square of a survivor index, so the sequence governs its own gaps through its squared values. A bootstrap argument yields the precise asymptotic growth of the survivors. We also introduce the extraction sieve $\\mathcal{C}_{j,y,z}$, a family of processes that repeatedly extract and delete elements from the bottom of an infinite sequence. On $\\mathbb{N}$, this sieve produces the $(j,1,y,z)$-hiccup sequence of Fokkink--Joshi, tautologically. Thus the ``silver sieve'' $\\mathcal{C}_{1,3,2}$ on $\\mathbb{N}$ is simply the Bosma--Dekking--Steiner $(1,1,3,2)$-hiccup with slope $1+\\sqrt{2}$. On arithmetic progressions $a\\mathbb{N}+b$, the sieve produces the new $(j,\\,a{+}b,\\,ay,\\,az)$-hiccup via an affine action on parameter space, providing an algebraic bridge between sieves and hiccup sequences."}

We further conjecture that this criterion characterizes all Drinfeld modular units; we verify the conjecture in the cases of prime power level and of level equal to the product of two primes.\n  Second, as an application of Drinfeld modular units, we investigate the rational cuspidal divisor class group $\\mathcal{C}(\\mathfrak{n})$ of $X_0(\\mathfrak{n})$.

T-S, as a natural set expressing some of the features of, say, H-L-like Correlations; these are the ones that mimic the H-L ($=$Hardy-Littlewood) Correlation with shift $2k$, needed to study $2k-$twin primes following Hardy \\& Littlewood Conjecture. After introducing the $3-$Hypotheses Correlations in a previous paper, we add two other, very natural, hypotheses: the fifth is a technical one, simplifying calculations; but the fourth is called 'Parity', since it deals with the parity of natural numbers we play with. In particular, we may build (devoting to this 'our mainstream', here) a single Correlation that satisfies these '5 Axioms', thus a T-S one, that 'entangles two different Correlations' (whence Two-Seasons: T-S) depending on $a$ ($=$ the shift) parity. For $a$ even, our 'Artifact' mimics the H-L Correlation, in fact $a=2k$; but, while H-L Correlation is 'negligible', say, on $a$ odd, our Artifact seems to compare at least in the order of magnitude to H-L Correlation on $a$ even, being linked to another additive problem. Namely, on $a$ even, the Artifact 'counts', say, classic solutions to: $p_1+a=p_2$, in odd primes $p_1,p_2$; while, on $a$ odd, it 'counts' solutions to: $p_1+a=2^j p_2$, again with odd primes $p_1,p_2$ and with $j\\in \\N$ (satisfying the natural arithmetic constraints). More in general, our T-S Correlations 'entangle' two different Diophantine equations."}
