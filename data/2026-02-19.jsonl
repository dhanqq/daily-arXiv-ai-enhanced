The results build on a detailed study of the stratifications of the moduli spaces coming from tropical geometry and the constraints coming from the weight filtration on the Borel--Moore homology groups of strata, extending the techniques from the previous study on $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}.$ Our results imply that the even homology of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,n}(\\mathbb{P}^r,d)$ is tautological and controlled by genus-zero and reduced genus-one Gromov--Witten theory. We verify the Hodge and Tate conjectures for $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,n}(\\mathbb{P}^r,d),$ completely describe its rational Picard group, and recover known results on the vanishing of odd cohomology.

The problem of finding a closed-form expression for $μ(r)$ was posed in early nineteenth-century Japan by Morikawa. It was proved by Holly and Krumm (2021) that no expression in radicals exists for $μ(r)$. In this article we show that $μ$ is an algebraic function, and consequently real-analytic on $[1,\\infty)$ outside a finite explicitly computable set. In particular, although no expression in radicals exists, the function admits convergent Taylor expansions at all non-exceptional values of $r$, whose coefficients may be computed by Newton iteration from the defining algebraic equation. We illustrate the method by explicitly computing the Taylor expansion of $μ(r)$ centered at $r=1$."}
