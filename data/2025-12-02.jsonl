We will also show that the quotient of $\\mathcal{U}$ by the action of $G$ is homeomorphic to $(X/G)^\\urcorner$, the compactification of $(X/G)(\\mathbb{C})$. We then apply these results to $X = \\mathrm{Rat}_d$, the space of rational maps and $G = \\mathrm{SL}_2$. It gives the results of C. Favre-C. Gong in a more general setting.

We establish conditions under which these invariants remain unchanged under bi-Lipschitz equivalence. In particular, we prove a special case of the metric version of Zariski multiplicity conjecture. We show that multiplicity is preserved when the ideal coincides with the integral closure of its order ideal. We also provide a partial answer to the open question of whether the local Euler obstruction is a bi-Lipschitz invariant. For hypersurfaces with isolated singularities, we show that the Euler obstruction is preserved under non-degeneracy conditions.

On the other hand, there exist sequences $A$ with optimal density $6/π^2$ for which infinitely many $n$ exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \\in A$ with $a < n$. In fact, infinitely many such $n$ exist for every exponentially increasing sequence, as long as the sequence avoids at least one residue class modulo $p^2$ for all primes $p$, a property we call admissible.
