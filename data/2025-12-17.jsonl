Those varieties have been characterized and classified for a long time in many aspects. Motivated by the question \"which varieties are the most basic and simplest except the above two kinds of varieties in view of geometry and syzygies?\", we give an upper bound of the graded Betti numbers in the quadratic strand and characterize the extremal cases.\n  The extremal varieties of dimension $n$, codimension $e$, and degree $d$ are exactly characterized by the following two types: (i) varieties with $d = e+2$, $\\operatorname{depth} X =n$, and Green-Lazarsfeld index $a(X)=0$, (ii) arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay varieties with $d = e+3$. This is a generalization of G. Castelnuovo, G. Fano, and E. Park's results on the number of quadrics and an extension of the characterizations of varieties of minimal degree and del Pezzo varieties in view of linear syzygies of quadrics due to K. Han and S. Kwak.\n  In addition, we show that every variety $X$ that belongs to (i) or (ii) is always contained in a unique rational normal scroll $Y$ as a divisor. Also, we describe the divisor class of $X$ in $Y$."}

Recently, it has been revealed that these bounds extend naturally to certain linear syzygies, suggesting the presence of a hierarchical structure governing the quadratic strand of graded Betti numbers.\n  In this article, we establish such a hierarchy in full generality. We first prove sharp upper bounds for $β_{p,1}(X)$ depending on the degree of a projective variety $X$, extending the classical quadratic bounds to all linear syzygies and identifying the extremal varieties in each range. We then introduce geometric conditions that describe how containment of $X$ in low-degree varieties influences syzygies, and we show that these conditions stratify the quadratic strand into a finite sequence of hierarchies. This leads to a complete description of all possible extremal behavior. We also prove a generalized $K_{p,1}$-theorem, demonstrating that the vanishing of $β_{p,1}(X)$ detects containment in a variety of minimal degree at each hierarchy."}
