By identifying the moment-generating function (MGF) of a random variable with the weights of these integrals, we first establish a general expression for complex fractional moments valid for any random variable with a MGF. Applying this formula to the Gaussian distribution, we recover a global integral representation for the reciprocal Gamma function that unifies it with its reflection. We formalize the underlying operator as the Parabolic Mellin Transform, a holomorphic alternative to the classical Mellin transform that avoids strips of convergence by mapping the vertical line to a parabolic contour. This general framework leads to new meromorphic representations for the Hurwitz and Riemann zeta functions that are valid throughout the critical strip, as well as reformulations of the Riemann hypothesis and the Lindelof hypothesis."}

We define and study a \"Tate-Shafarevich cohomology set\" that governs the obstruction to the local-global principle for $m$-atic twists. We prove that, under some mild assumptions, this set is finite, and give criteria for it to be trivial, i.e. for the local-global principle to be satisfied."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "A translational surface is a tensor product surface constructed from two space curves by translating one along the other. These surfaces are common within geometric modeling and, since their description is parametric, it is desirable to obtain the implicit equation of such a surface. These surfaces have been studied thoroughly by Goldman and Wang, where a particular set of syzygies was identified and shown to yield the implicit equation through an inhomogeneous resultant. As this method may fail in the presence of ill-behaved basepoints of the parameterization, we offer an alternative method in this article using iterated homogeneous resultants. The algorithm presented here involves smaller Sylvester matrices overall, potentially resulting in faster computation, and succeeds in many instances where the previous method cannot be applied."}

However, this case is known to be far from generic.\n  This paper deepens this connection with a similar correspondence in the substantially more complicated \"two column\" case. In particular, and building on works of Fresse, Melnikov, and Sakas-Obeid, we use webs to give a clean characterization of the smooth components of two column rectangle Springer fibers and a simple description of the geometry of these smooth components. We also show that the Poincaré polynomial of the smooth components is invariant under the natural dihedral action on the corresponding webs."}
