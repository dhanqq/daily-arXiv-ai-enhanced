Our focus is the distribution of this sequence over the sparse set of integers represented by a primitive, positive-definite binary quadratic form $Q$ of a fixed discriminant $D$. We establish an explicit upper bound for the summatory function of these coefficients, with dependencies on the weight, level, and discriminant. As a key application, we provide a bound for the first sign change of the sequence in this setting. We also generalize this result to find the first sign change among integers represented by any of the $h(D)$ forms of discriminant $D$, showing the bound improves as the class number increases."}

A lot of work has been done for algebraic varieties and a number of proofs of Fontaine's conjectures have been obtained between years 1985 and 2011.
