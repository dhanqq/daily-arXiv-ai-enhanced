Fernando", "Riccardo Ghiloni"], "title": "Subfield-algebraic geometry", "comment": "124 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "In this monograph, we lay the foundations for a new theory that generalizes real algebraic geometry. Let $R|K$ be a field extension, where $R$ is a real closed field and $K$ is an ordered subfield of $R$. The main objective is to study $K$-algebraic subsets of $R^n$, i.e., those subsets of $R^n$ that are the zero loci of polynomials with coefficients in $K$. Real algebraic geometry already covers the case when $K$ is also a real closed field. Our goal is to extend real algebraic geometry to the case when $K$ is not real closed, for example when $K$ is the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers. Several new geometric phenomena appear.\n  There is no complex counterpart to this generalized real algebraic geometry. The reason is as follows. If $C|K$ is a field extension with $C$ algebraically closed and $X$ is a $K$-algebraic subset of $C^n$, then Hilbert's Nullstellensatz implies that the ideal of polynomials with coefficients in $C$ that vanish on~$X$ is generated by the ideal of polynomials with coefficients in $K$ that vanish on $X$. In the real realm, this is false in general, for example when we consider field extensions $R|K$ with $R$ real closed and $K=\\mathbb{Q}$.\n  This monograph also presents some applications of the theory developed. Here is an example. The celebrated Nash-Tognoli theorem states that every compact smooth manifold $M$ is diffeomorphic to a nonsingular real algebraic set $M'$, called algebraic model of $M$. The theory developed here provides the theoretical basis to prove that the algebraic model $M'$ of $M$ can be chosen to be $\\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic and $\\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular. This guarantees for the first time that, up to smooth diffeomorphisms, every compact smooth manifold can be encoded both globally and locally involving only finitely many exact data."}

The integral solutions are related to the non-ordinary locus of the modulo $p$ reduction of the family, whose cardinality we bound in terms of the Euler characteristic and Lyapunov exponents of the base curve. In some cases, the non-ordinary locus can be recovered by truncating the integral solutions, as in Igusa's classical observation for the Legendre family. We also establish $S$-integrality of expansions of modular forms at cusps in terms of a modular function for (not necessarily arithmetic) Fuchsian groups with modular embeddings, and deduce congruences. These results are applied in subsequent work to construct lifts of partial Hasse invariants for rational curves in Hilbert modular varieties."}

In particular, we show that, under certain mild assumptions, the image of the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the associated absolute Galois group is not a normal subgroup. Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate.\n  These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work applying results from the theory of mapping class groups to the anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields, going beyond a mere analogy between the two."}

As applications, we extend Chow-Witt groups to schemes over general (possibly singular or arithmetic) bases, prove generalized Bloch formulas and representability results, and compute graded Chow-Witt groups over Dedekind schemes of finite type over the integers.

It turns out they are also elliptic nets, an $n$--dimensional array with values in $K$ satisfying the same nonlinear recurrence relation that division polynomials do as well.
